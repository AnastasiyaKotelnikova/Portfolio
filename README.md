## About Me

I’m Anastasiya — a Data Science graduate student at NJIT with hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, and big data systems. I work primarily with Python, SQL, and AWS, and have practical experience building and deploying data pipelines and ML workflows using EC2, S3, IAM, Hadoop, and MapReduce.

Alongside my studies, I work as an IT Support Technician at NJIT, supporting production systems and infrastructure in a real-world academic environment. I’m focused on building scalable, reliable, and ethical data-driven solutions, with strong interests in machine learning, cloud computing, and distributed systems.
